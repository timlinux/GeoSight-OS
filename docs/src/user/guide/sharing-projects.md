# Sharing Projects with Users and Groups

Once a project has been created, some administrators may decide that it should only be available to select users, groups or Country/Regional offices. This could be due to a number of reasons, including the protection of sensitive information.

All projects can be found by accessing the "Admin" tab by selecting the user icon on the top right of the Geosight page.

Once the Administrative section has been accessed, navigate to "Projects", where all existing projects can be found.

Next, select the network icon between "Preview" and the three vertical dots for the given project. This will lead users to the sharing permissions and page for the project. 

From the "Share" page, users can navigate to three different options, specific user access, group sharing and general access.

## Managing Users

On the user sharing page, administrators can select "Share to new user(s)" to add existing GeoSight users. Users can be selected via the navigable list, or by searching for them in the search bar. 

Finally, when adding users, it is important to set the permission level, which dictates the level of access allowed to the user. Permissions range from users being able to simply view projects, to being owners of the project with full access.

To complete the addition of users to a project, click "Add Users" once their desired permission level has been selected.

On the original Sharing navigation page, users and their permissisons can be managed. 

Select a user to enable the option to either delete their access to the project or change their permissions.

## Managing Groups

Groups are a cohort of users that has been created separately. Groups may be created to sort users by Country/Regional office, access level or any other number of reasons. 

In order to add groups, the process is similar as it is accessed from the same sharing page as users. Importantly, a group must _already be created_ to add them to the project.

Select "Share to new group(s)" to pick the groups you would like to share the project with and set their access level.

Click "Add groups" when the desired group has been chosen.

Like users, the initial  sharing page allows for groups to be removed from the project or have their level of access changed. 

## Adjusting General Access
General access is the level of availability for a given project to the entirety of GeoSight. Initially, all projects are viewable to all users. However, one may decide to make a project available to select users for a variety of reasons.

"Organization Access" determines on what level (and if) the entirety of UNICEF can access this project. The option "None" does not allow the entire organization to see the project. Selection of "Read" would allow everyone to view the project while "Write" would allow everyone to adjust and interact with the project.

"Public Access" allows all users to see the project. Select "read" to allow users to view the project and "None" to hide it from all public users.
