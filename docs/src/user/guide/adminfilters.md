# Filters
Filters are unique thresholds and criteria that can be set by users of a project to highlight areas of interest whose associated data points meet the threshold of interest. Unlike traditional symbology, which dictates the colors seen on a map, filters allow a for a malleable form of visual representation that can meet specific users' needs without changing the entire indicator.

## Accessing Filters
Filters can be accessed via the "Admin" tab. Navigate to this section by selecting it from the drop-down menu that results from clicking the profile icon in the top right corner. 

Once this page has been accessed, navigate to "Project" and click the name of your desired project under "Project Name".

From here, select "Filters" on the top bar. This will show existing filters, as well as giving you the capability to allow all filters to be adjusted by users of the project.

## Adding Filters
Filters can be added in a variety of ways, either as an individual or a combined group if multiple thresholds are desired.

To add a singular filter, click the plus icon labelled "Add New Filter". This will cause the "Create Filter" page to appear.

Once this page appears, name the filter, and add an optional description so users understand its purpose.

Next, select the indicator of choice. Users can sort by either the values of the indicator of interest, or the label associated with it.

Finally, select and define a mathematical operation. This can consist of a range of numbers, targeting values less or more than a certain number, or the existence of a given value.

If users wish not to allow all filters to be adjusted and instead just specific ones, they have the option to activate user abilities to modify the individual filter. 

Press "create" when you are satisfied with the filter.

### Creating Group Filters
To create group filters, the process is identical to creating an individual filter but allows users to sort by multiple criteria. 

Start by selecting the "Add New Group" icon and entering the initial filter information. This will create a new group where subsequent indicators can be added in the same way.

Users can adjust the interaction of filters, either looking for a combination of filters or a criterion of one filter or another. To do this, users can select the "And/Or" Slider option which will toggle between the two. 

## Editing Filters
To adjust a filter, click the pencil icon which prompts the same "Create Filter" Page, although it is now called "Update Filter"

## Removing Filters
To remove a filter or group, select the minus sign icon. This will prompt a message where users can confirm they want a filter or group of filters deleted.

Make sure to save all changes when complete
