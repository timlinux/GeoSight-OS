# Data Access
The data access tab is an administrator ability that allows for users to manage the entire lifecycle of access for data from creating and sharing the indicator, enabling data read/write, access for a given indicator, ingesting data and adding as indicator layers to the project. Although these features are distributed throughout GeoSight but the "Data Access" pane centralizes these operations.

## Accessing the Data Access tab
Data Access can be accessed via the "Admin" tab. Navigate to this section by selecting it from the drop-down menu that results from clicking the profile icon in the top right corner.

Once this page has been accessed, navigate to "Data Access". From here, you can manage data access by their users, groups or as an unaffiliated dataset. Similarly, you can filter by indicators, projects (Datasets), permissions or groups.

## Users
The user tab in Data Access allows for the mass sharing of an indicator with individual users or adjusting the existing permissions of an indicator.

If you wish to remove an indicator, click its check box and then "Delete"

If you wish to change permissions, without changing users, click the check box and then "Change Permission". This will allow you to select "Read" or "Write".

Finally, select "Apply Changes".

### Share to users
The share to users option allows multiple indicators to be shared across multiple projects and with multiple users.

First, select the "Share to users" tab which prompts the "Update Permission" page. From here, fill out the information that pertains to you, including the indicators you wish to update, what project they are a part of and which users you would like to change permissions for.

Finally, select the permission you would like to apply. This includes allowing users only to view the indicator (Read) or edit it (Write).

Press "Apply Changes" to save the new permissions.

## Groups
The groups tab in Data Access allows for the mass sharing of an indicator with individual groups or adjusting the existing permissions of an indicator.

If you wish to remove an indicator, click its check box and then "Delete"

If you wish to change permissions, without changing groups, click the check box and then "Change Permission". This will allow you to select "Read" or "Write".

Finally, select "Apply Changes".

### Share to Groups
Sharing to groups, as opposed to individual users, is a similar process.

The share to groups option allows multiple indicators to be shared across multiple projects and with multiple groups.

First, select the "Share to groups" tab which prompts the "Update Permission" page. From here, fill out the information that pertains to you, including the indicators you wish to update, what project they are a part of and which groups you would like to change permissions for.

Finally, select the permission you would like to apply. This includes allowing groups only to view the indicator (Read) or edit it (Write).

Press "Apply Changes" to save the new permissions.

## General 
The general tab, meanwhile, allows for the adjusting of access for indicators for the public, as well as UNICEF.

To change the access of either the public or organization, navigate to the appropriate labelled column for the desired indicator.

Click the box labelled "None" which means currently no one can view it and decide on if you would like to select "Read" or "Write".


Be sure to save any changes by clicking "Apply" in the top right corner.
