# Widgets
Widgets are a variety of statistical support tools that allows users to see summary information for a given indicator. They can present this data in a variety of ways, either as graphs, counts, or gauges although GeoSight mostly allows for counts of summary datasets.

## Accessing Widgets
Widgets can be accessed via the "Admin" tab. Navigate to this section by selecting it from the drop-down menu that results from clicking the profile icon in the top right corner.

Once this page has been accessed, navigate to "Project" and click the name of your desired project under "Project Name".

From here, select "Widgets" on the top bar. This will show existing filters, as well as giving you the capability to add widgets or groups of widgets.

## Adding Widgets
To add a widget, first select the icon labelled "Add Widget". This will prompt users to create a widget for either one indicator, or to combine statistics from multiple indicators. Whichever option you choose, the process is nearly identical.

In the "New Widget" tab first define a name, add an optional description and unit to indicate what the statistic is measuring.

Next, select the layer type. Currently the only option is to create widgets from indicators which is data.

Next, select the source layer which in this case will be indicator you wish to summarize.

Finally, select the mathematical operation you wish to apply to the indicator. Currently the only available option is finding the Sum of the indicator for the project.

If you wish, select the source value. (This option is currently unavailable)

If adding group widgets, select the group value. (This option is currently unavailable)

Finally, click "Apply" to create the widget(s).

### Grouping Widgets
If you wish to group widgets into categories, select "Add group" from the widget page.

This will create a sub-heading group where you can deposit indicators. Click the pencil to adjust the name.


Make sure to save your changes when you are complete.
