## Code Auto Documentation
<!-- mkdocstrings related -->

This process is now automated when `build-docs-html` is run in a local terminal.

## How to Make Documentation
<!-- To Be Populated -->

### Adding to Documentation

To start adding to the documentation navigate to the [home page](https://github.com/unicef-drp/GeoSight-OS) of the repository.

Once on the repository home page, (1) click on Fork
![Fork Repository 1](img/dev-docs-fork-repo-1.png)

On the next page (1) Make sure your github account is selected as the owner and (2) make sure you untick the option to  "**Copy the** `main` **branch only**" as you want to copy all branches.
![Fork Repository 2](img/dev-docs-fork-repo-2.png)

Once you have forked the repository, (1) click on the drop down menu underneath the repository title and then (2) click on the `docs` branch.
![Change Branch](img/dev-docs-change-branch.png)

Once you are in the `docs` branch on your fork of the repository, click on `.` on your keyboard. This will open a web editor where you can begin adding to, or editing, the documentation.
![Web Editor 1](img/dev-docs-web-editor-1.png)

Once the editor loads, you will be greeted by (1) a preview of the project's README.txt. (2) Click on the `docs` directory in the menu on the left, this will expand the directory. To confirm that you are working in the right branch (3) it will say `docs` in the bottom left of the editor.

Once you have expanded the `docs` directory, (1) click on the `src` directory. All sub-directories within the `src` directory contain the files that become the documentation. Each sub-directory contains an `index.md` file that is required for the building of the documentation and static site. If you add a new sub-directory into any folder it must also contain a populated `index.md` file.

Once you have chosen which section of documentation you would like to edit (e.g. user/guide/index.md), click on the file and it will open in the web editor.
![Web Editor 4](img/dev-docs-web-editor-4.png)

Once you have the file open, you can start adding to the documentation using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) syntax. If you need to add images to your documentation, add them to the relative `img` sub-directories following the naming conventions set out in the `naming-convention.README` within the `img` folders.

When you have completed making additions to (or editing) the documentation, (1) click on the source control tab then (2) click on the `plus` symbol next to the changes you are finished with to stage them, (3) add a commit message that is associated with the work you have done, and the (4) Click on `Commit & Push`
