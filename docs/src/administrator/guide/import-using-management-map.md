# Import Data Using the Management Map
Sometimes, it may be useful to add data to GeoSight via a map which allows you to select a given area and then enter a datapoint for it. This could be an advantage because data may come in an incomplete or inconvenient form such as a photo. If a photo of a map is shared, it is easiest to use the map provided by GeoSight to pick and choose data as illustrated in the photo. Otherwise, a user would have to take time to determine the name and location of all given areas, and then create an excel file and upload the data. The management map allows for that process to be streamlined.

## Accessing the Management Map
To access the management map, select the "Admin" option from the menu that appears when clicking the profile icon on the top right. 

Next, navigate to the "Indicator" tab and click the map icon labelled "Management Map" which is two to the right from the first choice, "Value List" for the desired indicator.

## Adding Data
The Management Map will open on a map. On the top right, one can find the option to change the reference dataset (or the country/region) they would like to input data for. 

Next, select the administrative level, or resolution, of the data you would like to input.

For each given district, first click the area of interest. This will create a pop-up.

In the pop-up, two options will appear, the date and the value. Enter both and press submit.

This will cause the value and date to appear on the right-hand side. Users can enter multiple values at once.

Continue this process for administrative areas of interest.

If a mistake is made, click the red "x" in the right-hand column to remove that datapoint.

All changes are saved automatically.
